# <u>Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing</u>

## <u>Overview</U>

This project involved the discovery, exploitation, and countermeasuring of security loopholes inside a virtual computer network system on Kali Linux and Metasploit. For the test approach, tools like Nmap and OpenVAS were used for the detection of system loopholes. These were high-risk exploits such as UnrealIRCd backdoors, poor PostgreSQL credentials, and Java RMI misconfiguration. A secure environment was used to explore the loopholes in order to demonstrate how attackers could gain unauthorized access and privilege escalation. Practical network fortification strategies were also proposed based on the outcome, including the use of SNORT IDS/IPS, firewalls, and stringent authentication mechanisms. 

I was able enhanced to enhance my technical skills in network security and vulnerability scanning as well as my ability to work in teams. With proper task delegation and communication, we were able to overcome technical challenges, allocated tasks properly, and successfully executed complex penetration testing within a virtual network environment.
