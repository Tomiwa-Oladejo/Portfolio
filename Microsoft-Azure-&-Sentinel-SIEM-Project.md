# <u>Microsoft Azure & Sentinel SIEM Project</u>

## <u>Overview</u>

For this project, I set up a simulated Security Operations Center (SOC) lab environment in Microsoft Azure and Sentinel. I provisioned a vulnerable Windows 10 VM as a honeypot to collect real-world attack data, including brute-force login attempts.
Using Sentinel and Log Analytics Workspace, I monitored real-time security events, wrote KQL queries to analyse suspicious behavior, and created custom dashboards to visualize attacker activity.
This hands-on experience taught me how to triage alerts, handle incidents throughout their lifecycle, and produce concise documentation. These are all vital skills needed to function effectively in a live SOC team.
