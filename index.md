I decided to create this website as a means to showcase the collection of various projects I have completed. The numerous projects within this portfolio have provided me with hands on experience in various areas of the captivating field that is cyber security. Furthermore, through the exploration of these projects, I have been able to vastly expand the scope of my knowledge, in addition to positively benefitting from the luxury of continuous learning. 

Please feel free to contact me if you wish to have a discussion.

## <u>Projects</u>
Below you can find an assortment of different projects:

### [Email Spam Filter](./Email-Spam-Filter.html)

> *   Engineered a machine-learning-based spam detection system leveraging Python and TensorFlow frameworks.
> *   Applied sophisticated preprocessing techniques such as tokenization and stop-word elimination to optimise dataset accuracy.
> *   Evaluated algorithmic performance through rigorous testing, documenting results in an extensive technical report.

### [Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing](./Vulnerability-Assessment-and-Penetration-Testing.html)

> *   Executed systematic vulnerability assessments of simulated enterprise networks to identify critical security weaknesses.
> *   Utilised industry-standard tools, including Nmap, Wireshark, and Metasploit, for network scanning, packet analysis, and exploit validation.
> *   Delivered comprehensive technical recommendations in a structured remediation plan, supported by empirical data.

### [Information Security Management Portfolio](./Information-Security-Management-Portfolio.html)

> *   Security Issue Identification & Analysis: Identified the specific security incident and analysed the techniques used by attackers, the           vulnerabilities exploited, and the affected assets (e.g., user data, company reputation).
> *   Impact & Threat Assessment: Evaluated the short- and long-term impacts of the breach on the organisation, including financial loss and           reputational damage, and identified potential threat vectors and vulnerabilities.
> *   Risk Management & Proposed Controls: Developed a risk register with identified risks and implemented procedural, technical, and physical         controls (e.g., firewalls, training programs, access controls) to mitigate future threats.

### [Computer Forensics and Investigation](./Computer-Forensics-and-Investigation.html)

> *   Conducted advanced forensic analysis utilising Cellebrite’s Physical Analyser to extract and parse digital data.
> *   Performed comprehensive evaluations of textual, multimedia, and application datasets to identify evidentiary artefacts.
> *   Synthesised findings into a detailed forensic report, adhering to rigorous methodological standards and evidentiary protocols.
