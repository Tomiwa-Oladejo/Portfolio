I decided to create this website as a means to showcase the collection of various projects I have completed. The numerous projects within this portfolio have provided me with hands on experience in various areas of the captivating field that is cyber security. Furthermore, through the exploration of these projects, I have been able to vastly expand the scope of my knowledge, in addition to positively benefitting from the luxury of continuous learning. 

Please feel free to contact me if you wish to have a discussion.

## <u>Projects</u>
Below you can find an assortment of different projects:

### [Email Spam Filter](./Email-Spam-Filter.html)

> *   Engineered a deep learning-based email spam filter using TensorFlow and Keras, implementing a neural network with embedding, flatten, and        dense layers to classify spam and non-spam messages with high        accuracy.
> *   Applied advanced NLP techniques including tokenization, stop-word removal, and punctuation stripping to pre-process text data, ensuring          optimized input for the model and improved classification              performance.
> *   Evaluated model performance using accuracy and AUC metrics; demonstrated the model’s ability to generalize by successfully predicting spam       in previously unseen data, highlighting practical application       for real-world email security systems.

### [Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing](./Vulnerability-Assessment-and-Penetration-Testing.html)

> *   Conducted in-depth vulnerability assessments using tools such as OpenVAS, Nmap, and Metasploit to identify and exploit network weaknesses        including UnrealIRCd backdoors, weak PostgreSQL credentials          and Java RMI misconfigurations.
> *   Collaborated effectively within a team to set up a secure virtual network environment using Kali Linux and Metasploitable, ensuring              consistent communication and smooth task delegation through strategy.
> *   Proposed and documented comprehensive network security improvements, including firewall configurations and the deployment of SNORT               IDS/IPS, demonstrating a strong understanding of practical defence          mechanisms and incident response.

### [Information Security Management Portfolio](./Information-Security-Portfolio.html)

> *   Designed and implemented an ISMS in response to Alibaba’s 2019–2020 data breach, addressing vulnerabilities from malicious web scraping of       1.1 billion records. Proposed layered technical, procedural, and physical safeguards.
> *   Developed cybersecurity strategies including IDS deployment, data classification policies, and encryption protocols, ensuring compliance         with China’s PIPL and enabling real-time threat monitoring.
> *   Translated technical risks into business impacts for stakeholders, highlighting reputational and financial consequences. Delivered               tailored solutions that strengthened Alibaba’s long-term security posture.

### [Computer Forensics and Investigation](./Computer-Forensics-and-Investigation.html)

> *   Conducted a smartphone forensic investigation using Cellebrite Physical Analyzer, extracting physical and logical images to uncover              evidence of premeditated theft.
> *   Analyzed communications, search history, and geolocation metadata to confirm suspect’s intent, presence at the scene, and behavioral             motives tied to financial stress.
> *   Recovered hidden data via hex analysis, built a detailed activity timeline, and compiled a court-admissible forensic report linking              digital evidence to criminal planning.

### [Denial of Service Attacks with Mitigations](./Denial-of-Service-Attacks-with-Mitigations.html)

> *   Conducted a comprehensive study on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks targeting the OSI model’s transport (Layer 4) and                application (Layer 7) layers, including SYN flood, UDP flood, HTTP flood, and Slowloris attacks.
> *   Analyzed and compared advanced mitigation techniques such as TCP SYN cookies, ingress/egress filtering, web application firewalls, and           reverse firewall mechanisms to evaluate their effectiveness against various attack vectors.
> *   Performed a structured literature review using reputable databases (IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect) to synthesize current            academic perspectives, assess threats to research validity, and support evidence-based cybersecurity recommendations.
