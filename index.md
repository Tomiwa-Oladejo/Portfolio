I created this website as a means to showcase a collection of cybersecurity projects I have completed. These hands-on experiences span various areas of this dynamic and ever-evolving field, including threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and SIEM operations. Each project has not only strengthened my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of cybersecurity principles in real-world contexts. Through these explorations, I have significantly expanded my knowledge base and embraced a mindset of continuous learning and improvement.

## <u>Projects</u>
Below you can find an assortment of different projects:

### [Microsoft Azure & Sentinel SIEM Lab](./Microsoft-Azure-&-Sentinel-SIEM-Lab.html)

> *   Deployed a honeypot Windows VM in Azure and configured log ingestion using Microsoft Sentinel via Log Analytics Workspace and Azure              Monitor Agent (AMA).
> *   Simulated a brute-force attack, generating over 24,000 failed login attempts to analyse alert behaviour.
> *   Created custom KQL queries to identify and filter failed login events (EventID 4625) by IP, account, and timestamp.
> *   Uploaded a geolocation watchlist and built a threat map in Sentinel Workbooks to visualise attack origin (Netherlands).
> *   Demonstrated key SOC workflows including detection logic, data enrichment, and visual reporting.



### [Email Spam Filter](./Email-Spam-Filter.html)

> *   Built a spam classifier using TensorFlow/Keras, achieving 92% accuracy on real-world email datasets.
> *   Applied NLP techniques for text cleaning, tokenization, and classification.
> *   Evaluated model performance using AUC and confusion matrix metrics.
> *   Gained experience in machine learning pipelines and email threat detection.

### [Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing](./Vulnerability-Assessment-and-Penetration-Testing.html)

> *   Conducted vulnerability scans using OpenVAS and Nmap across a simulated enterprise network.
> *   Identified and validated 29 vulnerabilities, including weak configurations and outdated services.
> *   Used Metasploit for manual exploitation of critical findings and documented structured remediation plans.
> *   Developed skills in vulnerability analysis, prioritization, and technical report writing.

### [Information Security Management Portfolio](./Information-Security-Portfolio.html)

> *   Designed an ISMS framework in response to a real-world data breach scenario (Alibaba case study).
> *   Created risk registers, mapped controls to ISO 27001 standards, and addressed GDPR compliance concerns.
> *   Produced detailed policy documentation covering risk management, incident response, and asset protection.
> *   Strengthened skills in security governance, risk assessment, and policy development.

### [Computer Forensics and Investigation](./Computer-Forensics-and-Investigation.html)

> *   Used Cellebrite Physical Analyzer to extract logical and physical data from mobile devices.
> *   Reconstructed digital timelines and correlated artifacts like SMS, app data, and geolocation records.
> *   Compiled a court-admissible forensic report, maintaining chain-of-custody and evidential integrity.
> *   Developed skills in forensic analysis, report writing, and evidence handling.

### [Denial of Service Attacks with Mitigations](./Denial-of-Service-Attacks-with-Mitigations.html)

> *   Analysed common transport and application-layer DoS attacks (e.g., SYN flood, HTTP flood, Slowloris).
> *   Evaluated system impacts and proposed layered mitigations such as WAFs, SYN cookies, and rate limiting.
> *   Linked research findings to broader business continuity and resilience planning strategies.
> *   Built knowledge in threat modeling and defensive security design.

(In the scenario a project appears on my CV and is not present on this portfolio, I have not had the opportunity to integrate it yet)
