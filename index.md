I decided to create this website as a means to showcase the collection of different projects I have completed. The numerous projects within this portfolio have provided me with hands on experience in various areas of the captivating field that is cyber security. Furthermore, through the exploration of these projects, I have been able to vastly expand the scope of my knowledge, in addition to positively benefitting from continuous learning. 

## <u>Projects</u>
Below you can find an assortment of different projects:

### [Microsoft Azure & Sentinel SIEM Project](./Microsoft-Azure-&-Sentinel-SIEM-Project.html)

> *   Deployed a Windows 10 honeypot VM in Azure and connected it to Microsoft Sentinel via Log Analytics Workspace.
> *   Monitored simulated attacks (e.g., brute-force login attempts) and analyzed security events using KQL queries.
> *   Built custom Sentinel dashboards to visualize threats and enriched log data for geographic tracking.
> *   Practiced alert triage, incident response workflows, and clear security event documentation.
> *   Gained practical experience with SIEM alert correlation, incident escalation, and SOC-style monitoring.

### [Email Spam Filter](./Email-Spam-Filter.html)

> *   Built a spam classifier using TensorFlow/Keras, achieving 92% accuracy on real-world email datasets.
> *   Applied NLP techniques for text cleaning, tokenization, and classification.
> *   Evaluated model performance using AUC and confusion matrix metrics.
> *   Gained experience in machine learning pipelines and email threat detection.

### [Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing](./Vulnerability-Assessment-and-Penetration-Testing.html)

> *   Conducted vulnerability scans using OpenVAS and Nmap across a simulated enterprise network.
> *   Identified and validated 29 vulnerabilities, including weak configurations and outdated services.
> *   Used Metasploit for manual exploitation of critical findings and documented structured remediation plans.
> *   Developed skills in vulnerability analysis, prioritization, and technical report writing.

### [Information Security Management Portfolio](./Information-Security-Portfolio.html)

> *   Designed an ISMS framework in response to a real-world data breach scenario (Alibaba case study).
> *   Created risk registers, mapped controls to ISO 27001 standards, and addressed GDPR compliance concerns.
> *   Produced detailed policy documentation covering risk management, incident response, and asset protection.
> *   Strengthened skills in security governance, risk assessment, and policy development.

### [Computer Forensics and Investigation](./Computer-Forensics-and-Investigation.html)

> *   Used Cellebrite Physical Analyzer to extract logical and physical data from mobile devices.
> *   Reconstructed digital timelines and correlated artifacts like SMS, app data, and geolocation records.
> *   Compiled a court-admissible forensic report, maintaining chain-of-custody and evidential integrity.
> *   Developed skills in forensic analysis, report writing, and evidence handling.

### [Denial of Service Attacks with Mitigations](./Denial-of-Service-Attacks-with-Mitigations.html)

> *   Analysed common transport and application-layer DoS attacks (e.g., SYN flood, HTTP flood, Slowloris).
> *   Evaluated system impacts and proposed layered mitigations such as WAFs, SYN cookies, and rate limiting.
> *   Linked research findings to broader business continuity and resilience planning strategies.
> *   Built knowledge in threat modeling and defensive security design.

(In the scenario a project appears on my CV and is not present on this portfolio, I have not had the opportunity to integrate it yet)
