# <u>Email Spam Filter</u>

## <u>Overview</u>

During my final year at university, I was drawn to the potential of how machine learning could be utilised for the improvement of cyber security solutions. To pursue this interest, I took the initiative beyond the normal curriculum to teach myself TensorFlow and Python and applied these capabilities in my final year project, with the objective being the development of a machine-learning-based email spam filter.

I learned and applied sophisticated data preprocessing methods such as tokenization and stop-word removal and experimented exhaustively with various algorithms to arrive at the best solution. This independent learning enabled me to better understand the ways in which intelligent systems can aid threat detection.
During the project, I was active in sharing my findings with peers in group discussions and in coursework sessions involving collaborative work. I exchanged ideas, offered technical advice when others worked on similar topics, and traded resources like tutorials and documentation. By doing this, I helped create a mutual learning environment while reinforcing my own understanding through peer interaction.

This demonstrated my ability to take initiative, learn new technical abilities, and help others through collaboration. Furthermore, my understanding of cybersecurity threats in digital communication was broadened, in turn with comprehension of how to build scalable and adaptive defense systems.
